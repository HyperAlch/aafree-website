              <h3>What is AAfree</h3>
              <p>AAFree is the first international archeage private server. Unlike other versions of archeage this private server isn't designed to milk every last penny out of you. With a variety of mixed and custom patches you can finally enjoy the ultimate fantasy-sandbox MMO of your dreams. </p>

              <h3>What does AAFree do differently</h3>
              <p>AAFree utilizes a variety of mechanics from Vanilla Archeage, these include version 2.9 trading, a combination of version 3.0 and 3.5 crafting, 4.0 combat as well as progression up to ancestral rank 7. But the content doesn't just stop there! Unlike other private servers, AAFree features a whole range of custom content, including a new world boss in the imperial city, several new zones, custom housing and much more.</p>

              <h3>Am I Too far behind</h3>
              <p>Unlike the live version of Archeage your character means something. Along with the progress you make on them. They are not something you throw away as soon as a fresh start is announced. This server is always updating gift boxes and catch up mechanics for new players.
                <br><br>
                The Gift box currently includes a divine T4 full obsidian set of your choosing, along with a free fishing boat, Farm cart, 16x16 farm, and house for new players. Also, with 500% increased exp gain, leveling should not be a problem either.
                <br><br>
                And with the increased labor system, making money with your free fishing boat and farm cart has never been easier.</p>
